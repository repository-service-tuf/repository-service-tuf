Preparing the environment
-------------------------

Create your development environment

Verify that you have Make installed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We use Make to run, build, update docs, tests, formatting, etc.
Verify that you have Make installed in your environment.

.. code-block:: console

    make --version

If you do not have ``Make`` installed,
consult your operating system documentation on how to install ``make``.


Docker
^^^^^^

Why Docker?

Docker simplifies development environment set up.

RSTUF uses Docker and `Docker Compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/>`_
to automate setting up a "batteries included" development environment. The
:file:`Dockerfile` and :file:`docker-compose.yml` files include all the
required steps for installing and configuring all the required external
services of the development environment.


Installing Docker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Install `Docker Engine <https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/>`_

The best experience for building RSTUF on Windows 10 is to use the
`Windows Subsystem for Linux`_ (WSL) in combination with both
`Docker for Windows`_ and `Docker for Linux`_. Follow the instructions
for both platforms.

.. _Docker for Mac: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/mac/
.. _Docker for Windows: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/windows/
.. _Docker for Linux: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/
.. _Windows Subsystem for Linux: https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/


Verifying Docker installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check that Docker is installed: ``docker -v``


Install Docker Compose
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install Docker Compose using the Docker-provided
`installation instructions <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>`_.

.. note::
   Docker Compose will be installed by `Docker for Mac`_ and
   `Docker for Windows`_ automatically.


Verifying Docker Compose installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check that Docker Compose is installed: ``docker compose version``


Python and Pipenv
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Make sure you have Python installed, we recommend the latest version of Python 3.x.

https://www.python.org/downloads/

Install Pipenv
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pipenv is a tool that automatically creates and manages a virtual environment
and it is used by the RSTUF project to manage dependencies.

After installing Python, install the pipenv tool:

.. code:: shell

    $ pip install pipenv


Create a virtual environment for this project:

.. code:: shell

    $ pipenv shell


Install the requirements from the Pipfile.

The flag -d will install the development requirements:

.. code:: shell

    $ pipenv install -d

Development
------------

.. note::
   RSTUF development can be done using Makefile scripts which
   execute all developer actions.
   
   The Makefile contains common commands to run the development environment.
   You can run ``make help`` to see all the available commands.

Here are some of the most common commands:

Running the development environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To run the development environment, use the following command:

.. code:: shell

    $ make run-dev

This will start the development environment with all the required services.
All changes done in the code will be reflected in the development environment.

- RSTUF API will be available at: http://localhost
- The TUF Metadata will be available at: http://localhost:8080

The logs will be available in the terminal where you started the development
environment.

You can stop the development environment with ``CTRL + C`` or stop it in 
another terminal with:

.. code:: shell

    $ make stop

To clean up the development environment, use the following command:

.. code:: shell

    $ make clean


Running checks with pre-commit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The pre-commit tool is installed as part of the development requirements.

To automatically run checks before you commit your changes you should run:

.. code:: shell

    $ make precommit

This will install the git hook scripts for the first time, and run the
pre-commit tool.
Now ``pre-commit`` will run automatically on ``git commit``.

Running tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To run the tests, use the following command:

.. code:: shell

    $ make test


How to add new dependency
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Install the new package as a dependency.

If you are adding a new package that is only needed for development, use the
``-d`` flag to install it as a development dependency.

.. code:: shell

    $ pipenv install -d <package>

If you are adding a new package that is needed for the application to run,
use the following command without the ``-d`` flag to install it as a runtime dependency.

.. code:: shell

    $ pipenv install <package>


Build local documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: shell

    $ make docs


Reformat the code (linters)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: shell

    $ make reformat


Submitting changes
==================

1. Create a new branch

.. code:: shell

    $ git checkout -b <new_change_name>

2. Perform the changes and commit them

.. code:: shell

    $ git add <files_you_changed>
    $ git commit -m "commit messaage"

3. Push your changes to your fork

.. code:: shell

    $ git push origin <your_new_branch>

3. Run local linters, tests, etc
4. Create a local commit with a `good title and description
   <https://blogs.vmware.com/opensource/2021/04/14/improve-your-git-commits-in-two-easy-steps/>`_

.. code:: shell

    $ git commit -a -s

4. Open a Pull Request

   Go to the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/repository-service-tuf/repository-service-tuf>`_ and create a new Pull Request from your branch.
