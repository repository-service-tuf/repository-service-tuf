We‚Äôre pleased to share the results of a recent **security assessment of the
Repository Service for TUF (RSTUF) services and tools**, conducted by
`X41 D-Sec GmbH <https://x41-dsec.de/>`_ through the
`Open Source Technology Improvement Fund (OSTIF) <https://ostif.org/>`_ and
funded by the
`Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) <https://openssf.org/>`_.

This independent audit is part of the RSTUF roadmap and an important milestone
toward releasing the first stable version, contributing to the open source
supply chain ecosystem.

üìÑ `RSTUF Security Audit Report <../../_static/docs/rstuf-audit-2025-report.pdf>`_

High-Level Summary
==================

The assessment focused on the design, implementation, and deployment of RSTUF
services and tools. The X41 team identified a set of findings ranging from low
to high severity‚Äîimportantly, **no critical vulnerabilities were discovered**.

Most findings relate to standard hardening practices and areas such as
configuration, access controls, and deployment defaults. These insights are
helping us improve the overall security and reliability of the RSTUF ecosystem.

All findings are tracked transparently in our public issue tracker:  
üîç `Audit Findings - GitHub Issue #852 <https://github.com/repository-service-tuf/repository-service-tuf/issues/852>`_

What‚Äôs Next
===========

The RSTUF team has already begun addressing the findings and implementing the
recommendations from the report. This includes improvements to security defaults,
documentation, and deployment guidance.

Security is a continuous process, and this assessment is a valuable step in our
ongoing efforts to deliver trusted and secure repository service for
`The Update Framework (TUF) <https://theupdateframework.io/>`_.
