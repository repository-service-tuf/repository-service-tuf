RSTUF v1.0.0 Release
####################

Author: Kairo de Araujo

Last update: 2025-08-29

We are excited to announce the **first stable release of the Repository Service
for TUF (RSTUF) â€“ v1.0.0**. This milestone marks the culmination of years of
development, community feedback, and security assessments, making RSTUF ready
for production use in modern software supply chains.

Key Features
============

This release brings a comprehensive set of features for secure, scalable, and
flexible repository management with:

**Root Metadata Signing**  
RSTUF now supports multiple signing backends for Root metadata, enabling strong
cryptographic assurance and flexibility in deployment:

- PEM files
- YubiKey hardware tokens
- Sigstore

**Online Keys for Automation**  
RSTUF supports automatic signing with online keys stored in:

- AWS/GCP/Azure KMS
- HashiCorp Vault
- Container Secrets

**Targets Metadata**  
You can now create and manage Targets metadata with powerful options:

- **Hash-Bin delegation**: optimized for high-traffic repositories or a large
  number of artifacts, using online keys.
- **Custom Delegations**: ideal for managing multiple sub-projects or splitting
  ownership of specific artifacts. This makes it possible to delegate signing
  responsibilities across teams, environments, or release stages.  
  For example, one team may control *staging* releases, another manages *QA*,
  and a third oversees *production*. Signers can use PEM keys, YubiKey,
  Sigstore, online keys, or even a mix of them to fit their needs.

**Storage Options**  
TUF metadata can be stored either in **container volumes** or **Amazon S3
buckets**, giving you deployment flexibility.

**CLI Tooling**  
A user-friendly CLI is included for managing repositories and using RSTUF
directly from the command line.

**API-First Design**  
With its API, RSTUF is simple to integrate into your **software development
lifecycle (SDLC)** and other automation workflows.

This enables seamless integration into CI/CD pipelines and automated release
processes.

Deployment
==========

To deploy RSTUF, we strongly recommend using our official Helm Charts:  
ðŸ“¦ `Deployment with Helm <https://repository-service-tuf.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide/deployment/guide/helm.html>`_

For full deployment and usage documentation, visit:  
ðŸ“– `RSTUF Documentation <https://repository-service-tuf.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide/index.html>`_

Future Work
===========

We believe RSTUF v1.0.0 is a strong foundation, but this is just the beginning.  
We are looking forward to hearing from the community about **what features
matter most next**.

Currently, our main focus is extending support for **hash-bin delegations
within Custom Delegations**. This will make it easier to combine scalable
hash-bin structures with fine-grained delegation ownership â€” a powerful setup
for large-scale artifact repositories with distributed trust models.

Community
=========

RSTUF is a community-driven project, and weâ€™d love for you to get involved:
